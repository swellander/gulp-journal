Create a journaling website where a user can write entries 
including at least a title and body. Create Entry objects 
that include a method to return the number of words in the 
entry. Then, add a separate method (or methods) to return the 
number of vowels and consonants in each entry. Call each of these 
methods from your front-end file to display their return values. 
Finally, add a method called getTeaser to return the first 
sentence of the entry. If the sentence is over 8 words, 
only display those first 8 words. Be sure to call this method 
from your front-end file to display the results as well, 
whenever a new journal entry is created.
